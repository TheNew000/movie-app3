#Movie App Created using the [Movie_DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)!

###While not the most aesthetically pleasing App I have created, I **REALLY** enjoyed myself while utilizing the MovieDB API.  I love the variety of calls one could make and all the information that could be culled and applied. What was most enjoyable was coming up with ways for the user to access and display the massive amounts of information attached to each movie title in the database.  There are a TON of calls that were made so feel free to look around the [scripts.js file](../blob/master/LICENSE)
